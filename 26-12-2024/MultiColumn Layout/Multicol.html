        <h1>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</h1>

        <p><b>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</b> is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML or XML. CSS defines how the elements of a web page are displayed, including the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects. CSS is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</p>

        <p>CSS can be used to define the layout of multiple web pages all at once. CSS allows web developers to control the appearance of web pages in a flexible and consistent manner, enabling changes to be applied to a large number of pages with a single edit to the style sheet.</p>

        <p>CSS allows for the separation of content and presentation. This separation enables web developers to structure their HTML content in a semantic way, while simultaneously applying a consistent style to the content. Styles can be defined directly within HTML files, or they can be contained in external style sheets that are linked to the HTML file.</p>

        <p><b>History of CSS</b></p>
        <p>CSS was developed by <i>Håkon Wium Lie</i> in 1994 while working at CERN, the organization that was also responsible for the creation of the World Wide Web. The first version of CSS was released in 1996, and it has been continuously developed with new features added over time. CSS 2 was released in 1998, followed by CSS3, which is the most current version and is made up of various modules that improve upon the previous versions.</p>

        </blockquote>

        <p class="clear-column">This is a special section that spans across all columns. 
        The content is spread across the entire width of the multi-column layout. This property is useful when you want a section to stand out or break the flow of columns.</p>

        <p>CSS enables developers to change the design and layout of a web page quickly without altering the content. It is incredibly powerful in controlling web pages' look and feel. When using CSS effectively, developers can create visually appealing and highly functional websites that are easy to maintain.</p>

        <p>In addition to layout control, CSS is used to define text styles, colors, spacing, positioning, and even responsive design. Responsive design techniques, using media queries, enable developers to create websites that look good on all devices, from mobile phones to desktop computers.</p>
